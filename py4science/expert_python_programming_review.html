<h1>Book Review: Expert Python Programming by Tarek Ziadé<a class="headerlink" href="#book-review-expert-python-programming-by-tarek-ziade" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I’ve slightly modified the language of this review, which as my
wife correctly pointed out to me, was unnecessarily harsh.  While I stand by
my previous evaluation of the book, I think the same things can be said in a
more constructive tone.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure</em>: In December of 2008 I was contacted by Packt publishing concerning
a review of their new book <a class="reference external" href="http://www.packtpub.com/expert-python-programming/book">Expert Python Programming</a>, by Tarek Ziadé.  What
follows is my review of the book based on a copy provided by the publisher, but
for which no compensation of any kind was given.</p>
<p>Note that I will not do a chapter-by-chapter listing of the book’s contents
here, since that is readily available both from the book’s site and from
reviews such as the one by <a class="reference external" href="http://ianozsvald.com/2009/02/08/review-expert-python-programming-by-packt-2008/">Ian Oszvald</a> and that by <a class="reference external" href="http://baypiggies.net/index_html/user-group-association-program/BookReviews/expert-python-programming-review/">James Stockford</a>.
Instead, I will try to provide my impressions on the strengths and weaknesses
of the book.</p>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Expert Python Programming</em> covers a list of very interesting topics regarding
real-world development using Python.  It assumes a reader who already knows the
basics of the language and covers a number of important topics, both in the
more advanced parts of the language and in terms of developing applications
using Python.  There is a strong emphasis on agile development practices,
testing, documentation, application life cycle management and other aspects of
‘real world’ work.  The list of topics covered is excellent, and the book is
well printed and bound.</p>
<p>However, unfortunately it suffers from rather poor editing throughout, with a
broken idea flow that makes for choppy reading.  Very few ideas are properly
developed, as the book relies excessively on code snippets, bullet lists and
stand-out info boxes.  Ultimately, this gives it more the feel of a set of
notes than that of a coherent volume.</p>
<p>This should not be read as an indictment of the book: the table of contents
alone is a list of ‘right things to do’ when using Python, and there is a great
deal of useful material in all of the chapters.  If you are looking for
reference material, links and starting points for further reading, <em>Expert
Python Programming</em> can be an excellent resource and well worth your
investment.  However, if you are searching for a text that develops complex
concepts at length, delving into details and subtleties, it might not be the
ideal tool for you.  I hope this provides a useful picture of the qualities of
this book.</p>

<div class="section" id="full-review">
<h2>Full review<a class="headerlink" href="#full-review" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After reading its table of contents I became very interested in the book, as it
covers a number of important topics for real-world software development.  The
book is <em>not</em> a basic Python tutorial but instead aimed at developers who
already know the language syntax and are interested both in using some of the
language’s more advanced features, and in adopting better practices in Python.
The book could be seen as “non-beginner-python + agile development practices
using Python tools” (I use the term <em>non-beginner</em> rather than <em>expert</em> because
more advanced aspects of the language, such as signature- and
introspection-preserving decorators, or sophisticated metaclass uses, are not
really covered at the <em>expert</em> level).  The book discusses topics beyond the
basic syntax (naming, class design, good APIs), application design strategies,
and topics that go outside of the language proper: testing, documentation,
automated build systems, multiprocessing, optimization and profiling, and more.</p>
<p>With this kind of topic list, the book appears as an excellent mix for doing
modern, sustainable software development using tools from the Python ecosystem
(for all of the covered topics, links are provided to tools that implement them
or provide the necessary support).  I have to admit, however, that I ended up
disappointed with the actual content.  I hope that these comments will serve as
constructive criticism for a possible second edition, because I really think
that this is a <em>draft</em> for a great book, just not a very good one yet.</p>
<p>The book simply feels too much like a collection of notes, links and snippets
about all of its topics, and very few ideas are developed at enough length to
provide genuine insight and understanding.  Almost every single page of the
book is a mishmash of code snippets, bullet lists and stand-out boxes, which
makes for difficult reading.  I realize that this is the age of twitter and the
10-second attention span, but for an ‘expert’ book I expected more exposition
of ideas with a sustained train of thought <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>.  As an exercise, I flipped through
every single page of the book, and I counted a total of <em>four</em> pages (210, 254,
255 and 331 for the curious) that were made up of full text unbroken by either
a bullet list, a snippet of code or a standout box.  I realize that code
examples are actually critical to a programming book, and the occasional list,
summary or highlight is useful.  But in this case there is just too much of it
and almost no serious development of the kind of complex topics that one would
expect from an expert level book.  Python is a language that, despite its
amazing clarity and simplicity, enables sophisticated programming approaches
and does have subtle corners.  This book unfortunately does not do justice to
such topics.</p>
<p>Additionally, the book is not helped by an overall sense of poor editing, with
a fair amount of grammatical errors.  I realize that the author’s first language
may not be English, but there should have been a much stronger editorial
support provided to assist him with the writing.  There are also,
unfortunately, technical errors.  For example on p. 55 a decorator called
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">synchronized</span></code> is defined but below, the name <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;locker</span></code> is used while no
function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">locker</span></code> was defined.  While this minor error can be easily spotted
by a reader, it suggests that the code snippets in the book were never actually
automatically run as part of a proper test suite that would ensure that the
printed code really executes without errors.</p>
<p>I think that the book suffered from overall insufficient editing, because it
really feels like a fantastic draft with all the right topics, ideas and tools,
that didn’t quite develop into the book it could be and was put to press
without being fully in shape yet.  I really hope that the author and publisher
consider this to be constructive criticism and revisit the book with a careful
eye for a solid second edition.  The topics covered are well chosen and there
is a genuine need for a book like this one.  Given that Python continues to
grow in a very healthy way as a programming language, I’m sure there will be
demand for such a book in the future.</p>
