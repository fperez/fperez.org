# fperez.org - HTML sources

This repo is a static HTML archive of my former website that used to live at fperez.org. I lost that site in 2022 due to a failure by my domain provider to notify me of its expiration, against ICANN regulations (name.com, I don't recommend them!).  I am publishing via  Github Pages at [fperez.github.io/fperez.org/](https://fperez.github.io/fperez.org) in order to have a public archive of the original site.

The underlying Sphinx sources [are here](https://github.com/fperez/fperez.org-src); this repo contains the last build I'd made of the site; on Dec. 27, 2017 (using Sphinx 1.6.3).

My official website now lives at https://fernandoperez.org.
